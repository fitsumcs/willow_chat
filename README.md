### ChatGPT-Inspired Chat Application

This project is a full-stack chat application featuring a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The app allows users to interact with a ChatGPT-like interface, save chat histories, and manage ideas. The backend communicates with OpenAIâ€™s GPT API, with a fallback to random text responses.

### Features

- Frontend: Built with React and Material-UI.
- Backend: Developed using FastAPI.
- Data Storage:
  - Chat history and saved ideas are managed on the frontend using local storage.
  - ChatGPT responses are fetched from the backend. (fallback response if chatgpt did not work)
- Dockerized: Both frontend and backend are containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.
